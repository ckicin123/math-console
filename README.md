# math-console
a console of a bunch of functions, mainly mathematical ones


this is what happens when my school started giving me free periods


ok this code holds many functions that are all mainly mathematical but not all of them

there is a function "showFunctions()" that describes all the functions and lists them off

# here are the ones that are not self explanatory enough to figure out do

# deVries(polinomial)

the de Vries equations are equations that relate the roots of a polinomial it's coefficients

example:

where y and u are the roots

ax^2+bx+c=0

x^2+(b/a)x+(c/a)=0

x^2+(b/a)x+(c/a)=(x-y)(x-u)

when this is expanded you get

x^2+(b/a)x+(c/a)=x^2-(y+u)x+yu

using this you can deduct that

b/a=-(y+u)

and

c/a=yu

# stringifyList(list)

puts a list in string form (good for data storage)

# destringifyList(string)

converts a string back into list from after being put through the function stringifyList()

# matricies functions

in my school i was taught matricies and to make sure i knew them i made these algorithms to calculate matricies, i have not been taught matricies beyond a 3x3, i feel like it's self explanatory how it goes beyond a 3x3 but i do not want to waste my time on making the functions work for any size matrix (the ones that require getting the minor of matrices) as i could very well just not know how to actually calculate them anyways
